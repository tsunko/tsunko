Hi, I'm tsunko, へい民 and your generic programmer with an anime avatar.
よろしく.

Stuff I've made/been involved in:
- [Vidmap](https://github.com/tsunko/vidmap) (please use with [UnsafeMaps](https://github.com/tsunko/unsafemaps))
- Former [plugin suite](https://github.com/tsunko/tenkore-meta) used on YukkuriCraft, a Touhou-oriented Minecraft server
- Reverse engineering KemoFure Pavilion + Initial dive into Nexon's KemoFure game 

Currently working on:
- Learning [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
- Completely custom keyboard + Bare metal firmware (of course, in Zig).

If you need to contact me, I can be reached by email or by sending a direct message via Discord (\<my github name\>#0001).
