Hi, I'm tsunko, へい民 and your generic programmer with an anime avatar.
よろしく.

Currently working on:
- Learning [Zig](https://ziglang.org/)
- [Vidmap](https://github.com/tsunko/vidmap)
- Trying to understand FFmpeg's documentation.

If you need to contact me, I can be reached by email or by sending a direct message via Discord (<my github name>#0001).
